guardian-sync provides a PGP encryption layer for zero-trust cloud storage. Files are automatically encrypted with PGP before they sync, and decrypted locally when needed.<br>
All encryption and decryption happens on your device, ensuring your data remains private and secure.

## Features

- Automatic PGP encryption of files before they sync
- Automatic decryption of files when they're updated
- Works with your existing cloud sync client installation
- Monitoring for local changes
- Event-based checking for remote changes

## Requirements

- Python 3.10.x or higher
- GnuPG installed on your system
- Some cloud sync client installed and configured on your computer

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/MK2112/guardian-sync.git
   cd guardian-sync
   ```

2. Install the package:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Create a PGP key if you don't already have one:
   ```
   gpg --full-generate-key
   ```
   Follow the prompts to create your key. Remember the name you use for your key.

4. Create or update the configuration file (`config.json`):
   ```json
   {
     "local": {
       "monitored_path": "./secure_files",
       "decrypted_path": "./secure_files"
     },
     "sync_folder": {
       "path": "",
       "encrypted_folder": "encrypted_files"
     },
     "pgp": {
       "key_name": "your_key_name",
       "passphrase": "",
       "gnupghome": "~/.gnupg",
       "always_trust": false
     },
     "sync": {
       "check_interval": 60
     },
     "log_file": null
   }
   ```
   
   **Notes:**
   - Use `sync_folder.path` to specify the full path to your cloud sync folder (e.g. for DropBox, Google Drive, SyncThing, etc.)
   - Set `pgp.key_name` to the name you used when creating your PGP key
   - Leave `pgp.passphrase` empty to be prompted each time, or set it for automatic operation (less secure)
   - Set `pgp.always_trust` to `true` only if you understand the risks; by default it is `false` for better security
   - Persisted logging is optional:
     - Set `log_file` to a path (e.g. `"guardian-sync.log"`) to enable file logging
     - Set `log_file` to `null` to disable file logging entirely (only console logs)
   - All files in the monitored directory, including hidden files, are encrypted and synced.
   - The tool automatically handles file overwrites and creates conflict files if both local and remote versions change independently.

## Usage

### Quick Start

1. **Add files to encrypt:**  
   Place any files you want to keep secure into your chosen "monitored" directory (e.g. `secure_files/`).  
   
   *An example could be:*  
   ```bash
   echo "my-secret-password" > secure_files/passwords.txt
   ```

2. **Start guardian-sync:**  
   Run the application to automatically encrypt new or changed files in your monitored directory:

   ```bash
   guardian-sync
   ```
   You can specify a custom config file if needed:
   ```bash
   guardian-sync --config /path/to/your/config.json
   ```

3. **Encrypted files appear:**  
   guardian-sync will automatically:
   - Detect new or updated files in your monitored directory.
   - Encrypt them using your PGP key.
   - Place the encrypted versions (e.g. `passwords.txt.gpg`) in the configured encrypted folder (e.g. `encrypted_files/`).

4. **Accessing your files elsewhere:**  
   - To decrypt a file, guardian-sync will automatically detect new encrypted files in your encrypted folder and decrypt them back to your monitored directory.
   - You can safely sync the encrypted folder (`encrypted_files/`) with any cloud service (e.g. Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, Syncthing, etc.), knowing only encrypted data leaves your device.

### Tests

Run the tests with:
```bash
pytest ./tests/
```

### Example Workflow

- Add a file to `secure_files/`  
  - guardian-sync encrypts it to `encrypted_files/filename.gpg`.

- Sync `encrypted_files/filename.gpg` to another device  
  - guardian-sync decrypts it back to `secure_files/filename`.

Your files are always encrypted before leaving your device. Only you, with your PGP key, can decrypt them.

## Security Considerations

- Your files are only stored in encrypted state in the cloud
- Decryption happens locally on your device
- Your PGP private key never leaves your device
- It is recommended to use a strong, unique passphrase for your PGP key
- If you specify your passphrase in the config file, which isn't recommended, ensure the file is properly secured
- Only you should know your passphrase and private key, nobody else, at any point

## Troubleshooting

- If enabled, check your log file for detailed information and auditability
- Ensure your PGP key is properly set up and accessible
- Verify your sync folder folder path is correct
- Make sure the sync folder client is running and properly syncing
- Make sure you have proper permissions for the directories in your config
